I have been learning Zig for past few days and I am really enjoying it.
Going through [zig reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zig/),
I found what looks to be a good way to learn Zig: [Ziglings](https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises). 
Today, I will go through the Ziglings exercises and share my experience.

### Intended Audience

> This will probably be difficult if you've never programmed before.
> But no specific programming experience is required.
> And in particular, you are not expected to have any prior experience with "systems programming" or a "systems" level language such as C.
> [...](https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises/#intended-audience)

I tried to solve the exercises it starts with very basic concepts and gradually introduces more complex concepts.
So, this is a good way to learn Zig from scratch if you have some programming experience.

### Exercises

There are 109 exercises starting from basic "Hello World!" to `comptime` features.
Each exercise has a explaination of what needs to be done for the exercise, and test case to verify the solution.
